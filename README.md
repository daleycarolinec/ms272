# The Relative Importance of Habitat Structure to Subtidal Fish Communities 
MS 272 Subtidal Ecology Final Project | Moss Landing Marine Laboratories | Spring 2025

This project explores how the existing benthic structure, the installation of artificial kelp, and their interaction effects fish communities in Stillwater Cove, CA. Visual fish surveys were conducted via SCUBA before the installation of artificial kelp within a known transect (10m long by 2m wide). Surveys were repeated 1 hour and 1 week following artificial kelp installation. For each fish observed within the trasnect, recoderes noted species and length (categorized in 5cm increment size bins). Substrate was defined at 1m intervals along the transect, and relief was estimated using UPC methods from PISCO surveys. Species codes, if not included in the 'Species_Code' tab in the master datasheet, are comprised of the first letter of the genus and first three letters of the species (e.g. Sebastes carnatus = SCAR).
